## 9. Adding Issue Number in the Pull Request Message

When you open a pull request, it's a good practice to include the issue number that the pull request relates to. This helps the repository maintainers to keep track of the changes made to the repository and to understand the context of the pull request.

To include the issue number in the pull request message, you can use the pound sign (#) followed by the issue number. For example, if your pull request relates to issue #42, you can include the following message in the pull request:

```bash
This pull request relates to issue #42
```

Make sure to replace "42" with the actual issue number that your pull request relates to.

By including the issue number in the pull request message, you can help the repository maintainers to better understand the context of your changes and to prioritize the pull request review process.

That's it! We appreciate your contribution and will review your Pull Request as soon as possible.
